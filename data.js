            <span style="font-size: large;">Abstract:<br>
            This paper estimates the effect of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) on adult obesity addressing self-selection and endogenous misreporting of participation. There is increasing evidence suggesting that the consequences of reporting errors in program participation may be severe enough to render the sign of the treatment effect not to be identified by standard methods. Using a two-step procedure that accounts for endogenous misreporting of participation, this paper estimates the causal impact of SNAP on obesity using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth – 1979 cohort. From a simple partial observability model of participation and misreporting, I predict probabilities of participation which are used to consistently estimate the average effect of SNAP on body mass index (BMI). I rely on exclusion restrictions for program participation and reporting errors for identification. The estimated misreporting model confirms some prior findings in the literature regarding the correlates of reporting error. However, contrary to most previous studies, I do not find any evidence of a statistically significant effect of SNAP on BMI.</span></p>

In particular, they test the effect of democracy on the level of voluntary contributions in public goods games. They find that allowing people to vote on the public good significantly increases contributions. Moreover, the higher contributions persist over repetitions of the game while contributions fall to almost zero when participants are not able to vote on the public good. <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/aq6gtdcmgwxh1h3/voting%20paper.pdf?dl=0">Link</a>.</p>`,

            <span style="font-size: large;">Abstract:<br>
            This paper estimates the effect of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) on adult obesity addressing self-selection and endogenous misreporting of participation. There is increasing evidence suggesting that the consequences of reporting errors in program participation may be severe enough to render the sign of the treatment effect not to be identified by standard methods. Using a two-step procedure that accounts for endogenous misreporting of participation, this paper estimates the causal impact of SNAP on obesity using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth – 1979 cohort. From a simple partial observability model of participation and misreporting, I predict probabilities of participation which are used to consistently estimate the average effect of SNAP on body mass index (BMI). I rely on exclusion restrictions for program participation and reporting errors for identification. The estimated misreporting model confirms some prior findings in the literature regarding the correlates of reporting error. However, contrary to most previous studies, I do not find any evidence of a statistically significant effect of SNAP on BMI.</span></p>

      <p>Marius Chabi is a Beninese national. He holds a Masters degree in Public Economy and Applied Statistics (MEPSA in French) obtained at the IERPE, one of the 3 Institutes under the African School of Economics (ASE). After graduating from the IERPE in September 2013, he first worked as the Data Manager at the Centre de Recherche et d’Appui-Conseils pour le Développement (CRAD) in Benin. Despite his young age, Marius landed this job 6 months prior to completing his training – an achievement he attributes to being trained at a prestigious institution like the ASE. He entered the international professional world in February 2014. Marius became a Data Analysis consultant with DHL Benin, on a Laval University project. He did not stop at that! He later became a Graduate Student at the Focus Scientific Research Center in Bangolore, India. In March 2015, owing to his deep commitment to Africa, Marius Chabi did not hesitate to accept an Oxfam America offer to work in Senegal. In Dakar, he was the Regional Monitoring and Evaluation Assistant for Oxfam.</p>
      <p>Marius Chabi has been a Research Manager for Innovations for Poverty Action in Kigali, Rwanda, since March 2016.

      <p>More than a decade after graduating from the African School of Economics, Damase Sossou talks about ASE. He explains the positive experiences he had as a student at this Pan-African university.</p>
      <p><b><strong>The Communications team</strong></b>: Our first point of interest: what was your course of study at the ASE?</p>
      <p><b><strong>Damase Sossou</strong></b>:&nbsp;I was part of IERPE’s first cohort, the oldest of the ASE’s institutes. I was one of the first students to graduate with a Master’s degree in Public Economy and Applied Statistics (MEPSA) in 2006. Prior to that, I received my education in Statistical Works Engineering at ENEAM (National School of Applied Economics and Management, formerly INE, National Economics Institute).</p>
      <p><b><strong>The Communications team</strong></b>:&nbsp;What was your first job after ASE?</p>
      <p><b><strong>Damase Sossou</strong></b>:&nbsp;I had already been a research assistant when I was still an ASE student. I worked on the school’s political economy and local governance research projects. Afterwards, even before graduating from the ASE I was recruited by the civil service in 2008, where I still work.</p>
      <p><b><strong>The Communications team</strong></b>:&nbsp;Did the ASE contribute to this success?</p>
      <p><b><strong>Damase Sossou</strong></b>:&nbsp;Honestly, I successfully passed the civil service recruitment test thanks to the background I got from studying at INE. But I stood out among the rest at work thanks to my education at ASE. The technical capabilities I acquired at ASE enabled me to have good instincts when dealing with certain cases, and I had an especially interesting career path thanks to my particular way of analyzing issues.</p>
      <p><b><strong>The Communications team</strong></b>:&nbsp;Okay, what did the ASE really bring you professionally that makes you stand out among your colleagues?</p>
      <p><b><strong>Damase Sossou</strong></b>:&nbsp;It brought me broadmindedness regarding all sociology and governance-related issues, which often gives my analyses multiple points of view. And these are things an individual who has not received such an education does not necessarily have. I also remember that the ASE helped me get an internship at the University of Cape Town (South Africa) in 2007. It was an enriching experience.</p>
      <p><b><strong>The Communications team</strong></b>:&nbsp;What is your relationship with ASE today?</p>
      <p><b><strong>Damase Sossou</strong></b>: Currently, I work with ASE’s CEIPP program as an instructor. I am also an associate researcher. For example, as part of the last communal elections, I worked on a research project with professor Wantchekon, the founder of the ASE, on elections issues. I am also working with the professor and some of his colleagues based at the Toulouse School of Economics and in Spain, on a research project targeting the improvement of the performance of workers in their duties at commune level.</p>
      <p><b><strong>The Communications team</strong></b>:&nbsp;We are almost at the end of this interview, what advice do you have for our readers?</p>
      <p><b><strong>Damase Sossou</strong></b>:&nbsp;I want to specify that all those who studied at ASE stand out everywhere they go; whether Beninese or foreign nationals, they work in the best institutions. Anyone who really wants to impact the world with strategic thinking on development issues must choose ASE. As for those who only need a small training for a short term job, I advise they go for other schools. (Laughter)</p>
      <p><b><strong>The Communications team</strong></b>:&nbsp;Thank you.</p>

      <ol start="4">
      <li><strong>Where will you pursue your Ph.D.? Why did you choose to continue your studies there?</strong></li>
      </ol>
      <p>I will be pursuing my PhD at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign. I choose to study at this school not only because the coursework is well-balanced between the three core areas of economics, but also because they have a very strong department of development economics, which happens to be the field I wish to specialize in.</p>
      <ol start="5">
      <li><strong>How did ASE help you gain acceptance to a doctoral program?</strong></li>
      </ol>
      <p>ASE played a major role in getting me accepted to this doctoral program. The Pre-Doctoral program through the GRE and TOEFL courses gave me the necessary skills and preparation to tackle both tests. But, first and foremost, I owe this opportunity to the coursework offered at the school, which is rigorous and innovative enough to help us compete with the best students in the world.</p>
      <ol start="6">
      <li><strong>How would you describe the student experience at ASE?</strong></li>
      </ol>
      <p>The student experience at the African School of Economics, I would say, is incredibly rich. Given that the program is highly demanding, students are pressured to go beyond their limits. Studying in groups helped me overcome many challenges and makes the student experience less painful and more interesting.</p>
      <ol start="7">
      <li><strong>What is your best memory from ASE?</strong></li>

      <p>Thriving and succeeding at ASE required massive personal sacrifice and investment. Staying up all night in the library with classmates was demanding, exhausting and fun, all at once. Those moments were definitely the best memories I have from ASE.</p>

For instance, the technical skills I gained there helped me successfully finish the Advanced Master in International and Development Economics, co-organized by the University of Namur and Université Catholique de Louvain, Belgium.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Communication Team:</strong> &nbsp;<strong>Where will you pursue your Ph.D.? Why did you choose to continue your studies there?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>R. Djidonou:</strong> I will pursue my Ph.D. at the United&nbsp;Nations University-Maastricht Economic and Social Research Institute on Innovation and Technology (UNU-MERIT) located in the University of Maastricht, Netherlands.&nbsp; The program is more technical and trains individuals to work in the United Nations, International Organizations, national governments, and academia. It highly fits my career objectives.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Communication Team:</strong> <strong>How did ASE help you gain acceptance to a doctoral program?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>R. Djidonou:</strong> The fact that ASE’s program is in English and the content of the program itself were both helpful for my admission.</p>
      
      <p><strong>&nbsp;Communication Team: &nbsp;</strong><strong>How would you describe the student experience at ASE?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>R. Djidonou:</strong> We have a unique student experience at ASE. Students are involved in several research activities through work study contracts and gain useful experiences for their career.</p>

      <p><strong>What was your academic and professional background before ASE?</strong></p>
      <p>Before ASE, I was studying pure mathematics at the University of Yaoundé I.</p>
      <p><strong>What skills did you gain from your coursework at ASE?</strong></p>
      <p>ASE makes me discover the dynamism that I am capable of. I learned to be fluent in English and to speak without any fear in front of people.</p>
      <p>I learned softwares like Stata, R and Latex.</p>
      <p>At ASE I learned how to ask hard questions and generate responses based on the results of analysis. I learned how to do analysis to build systems that would act as intermediaries between public officials and the citizens they serve, both asking and answering questions relevant to choices that have a lot of impact on people’s lives.</p>
      <p>I learned how theory in mathematics can be used in modeling and testing real life situations. I strongly believe that in order for us to collectively solve the most pressing issues of our time, we need to devise solutions driven by rigorous scientific analysis and aided by modern advances in computation.</p>
      <p><strong>Where will you pursue your Ph.D.? Why did you choose to continue your studies there?</strong></p>
      <p>I will study at Georgia State University because their doctoral program in economics takes a pioneering approach that emphasizes public policy and empirical evaluation. In addition, I chose this program because of the high academic standards and policy orientation, internationally renowned faculty and their good research centers.</p>
      <p><strong>How did ASE help you gain acceptance to a doctoral program?</strong></p>
      <p>ASE helped me by preparing me for the GRE and TOEFL exams. In fact, we spent like three months with PiAf (Princeton in Africa Fellows) like Sarah Pollnow preparing for those exams.</p>
      <p><strong>How would you describe the student experience at ASE?</strong></p>
      <p>I will say intense in courses, hard work, innovation and research.</p>
      <p><strong>What is your best memory from ASE?</strong></p>
      <p>My best memory at ASE was in December 2017, when I had the privilege to present my master thesis at SIER in front of many professors from Princeton University, Georgia State, and the Ghana Institute of Management and Public Administration. This experience was at the same time concrete and filled with emotion.</p>

      <p><strong>What is your name, country and course of study?</strong></p>
      <p>My name is Sossou Simplice Adjisse. I am from Benin. I have studied Mathematics, Economics and&nbsp;Statistics at ASE.</p>
      <p><strong>What was your academic and professional background before ASE?</strong></p>
      <p>Prior to ASE, I had earned a master’s in Mathematics at the University of Abomey Calavi. I had also followed a CAPES training in Ecole Normale Supérieure de Porto-Novo and was a mathematics teacher in middle schools and high schools.</p>
      <p><strong>What skills did you gain from your coursework at ASE?</strong></p>
      <p>Coursework at ASE built and sharpened my research and analytical skills. I learned how to produce good research outputs in economics and related fields and surely this will help me a lot for my PhD.</p>
      <p><strong>Where will you pursue your Ph.D.? Why did you choose to continue your studies there?</strong></p>
      <p>I will pursue my PhD in Development Economics at the University of Wisconsin Madison. I will be taking joint courses in the Economics Department for one and a half years (3 semesters) before finishing my specialty courses and my dissertation in the Agricultural and Applied Economics Department.&nbsp; I chose Wisconsin Madison because this type of program is all I have been dreaming of since I decided to pursue a PhD: the Economics of the real world rigorously rooted in a very strong theoretical program perfectly balanced between the core components of economics, which are Microeconomics, Macroeconomics and Econometrics.&nbsp; Moreover, the University of Madison is highly ranked and has the reputation and a long tradition of giving high quality knowledge.</p>
      <p><strong>How did ASE help you gain acceptance to a doctoral program?</strong></p>
      <p>First of all, ASE instilled in me the dream of earning a PhD in order to significantly contribute to the scientific research in economics. Secondly, ASE encouraged and supported me in every aspect of the way from the preparation of the PhD applications until my admission by providing financial aid, trainings and coachings, thanks to the Princeton in Africa Fellows (PiAfs: Alex, Sarah, Anna and Ibilola) and the Professor Leonard Wantchekon.</p>
      <p><strong>How would you describe the student experience at ASE?</strong></p>
      <p>My experience as a student at ASE is the best I have ever had. First, I have friends from a diverse range of countries and then IERPE is a breeding ground for students to become good researchers. Secondly, ASE’s environment is very competitive and students have everything they need to be motivated and dream big.</p>
      <p><strong>What is your best memory from ASE?</strong></p>
      <p>I have lot of good memories from ASE, but the best one is my admission to&nbsp;a&nbsp;PhD&nbsp;program.</p>

    about: `

      <p class="">Kaycee Chibuzor Uyanwa (b. 1993) is a Nigerian artist based in Abuja, who is known for his photo realistic pencil and charcoal portraits of black subjects that embody the complex emotions associated with the contemporary and native black experience. His art is born out of the zeal for perfection both in skill, expression and devotion to create positive changes in the world.</p>
      <br /><br />
      <strong class="font-bold">The Journey:</strong>
      <p class="">Kaycee began drawing at the age of five, using graphite pencils on paper materials he finds around his family house. The self-taught artist developed his photorealistic style by employing what he calls the three Ps: patience, practice, and perseverance. Kaycee works from reference images, and his own imagination to create these methodical works: He often spends up to one to two months completing a single portrait. Inspired by his personal experiences being  an African, Kaycee’s practice speaks to the beauty, realities of the African culture and cultural appreciation and conveys his commitment to portraying and preserving the beautiful cultures of Africa at large.</p>
