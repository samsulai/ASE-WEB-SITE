For example, I enjoyed the improvement English and Mathematics courses offered at the beginning of the first semester. I also greatly appreciate the availability of ASE's professors and administration, who work hard to help students achieve their goals. In particular, the PiAfs (Princeton in Africa Fellows) have helped me remarkably not only with strengthening my English but also with familiarizing myself with North American writing methodologies.",
