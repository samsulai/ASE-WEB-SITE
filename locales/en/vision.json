    "Economic development results, at least in part, from the development of innovative economic ideas. The process of generating these ideas is invariably endogenous, and mostly homegrown. Africa is no different. Debates over the soundness of economic policy, the role of institutions, and the impact of development interventions need to incorporate more highly trained African researchers. To this end, the African School of Economics strives to provide young researchers with not only rigorous methodological training, but also with the opportunity to actively apply this training to current social problems via close collaborations with government agencies, international organizations, and businesses. The university’s multi-disciplinary curricula, intertwining modern economic thought with African history, enables students to gain a dynamic understanding of the processes and events that shape and continue to shape development across the continent. We hope that the combination of this training, paired with ASE’s open, collaborative research environment, will leave students with the necessary skills and strong commitment to join a community of scholars actively contributing to the exchange of knowledge regarding African development.": "Economic development results, at least in part, from the development of innovative economic ideas.
